      <h1>Free AI Tools for College Students 2025 - The Complete Guide</h1>
      
      <p>College is expensive. Between tuition, books, rent, and ramen, most students don't have budget for premium tools.</p>

      <p><strong>Good news:</strong> The best AI tools have free versions that are powerful enough for students.</p>

      <p>In this guide, I've compiled the top free AI tools for essays, research, coding, presentations, and more. Cost: ₹0.</p>

      <h2>1. ChatGPT (Free) - Essay Writing, Research, Brainstorming</h2>

      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Brainstorming essays, understanding concepts, debugging code</p>
      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Free (ChatGPT 4o mini is surprisingly powerful)</p>
      <p><strong>How students use it:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Brainstorm essay topics: "Give me 5 essay ideas about [topic]
        <li>Explain confusing concepts: Paste notes and ask "Explain this in simple terms"</li>
        <li>Outline essays: "Create a 5-paragraph essay outline on..."</li>
        <li>Check grammar: Paste paragraph and ask "Check for grammar mistakes"</li>
        <li>Study for exams: "Quiz me on [subject topic]"</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>⚠️ Don't:</strong> Copy-paste ChatGPT's essay directly. You'll fail plagiarism checks. Use it for ideas and understanding.</p>

      <h2>2. Claude (Free) - Understanding Code & Concepts</h2>

      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Debugging code, explaining how something works, writing explanations</p>
      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Free (100+ messages/day)</p>
      <p><strong>Why students love it:</strong> Claude explains BETTER than ChatGPT. Paste broken code and it tells you exactly why it fails.</p>
      <p><strong>Real example:</strong> "Why is this Python code giving a KeyError?" Claude explains: "You're accessing a dictionary key that doesn't exist. Here's the fix..."</p>

      <h2>3. Perplexity AI (Free) - Research, Fact-Checking, Sources</h2>

      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Research papers, finding sources with citations, learning new topics</p>
      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Free</p>
      <p><strong>Why it's better than Google:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Answers questions directly (no clicking 10 links)</li>
        <li>Cites sources automatically (screenshot for your paper)</li>
        <li>Searches web real-time (latest info for current events essays)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example use:</strong> "Who won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Medicine?" → Gets answer + sources in 5 seconds</p>

      <h2>4. Gemini (Free via Google) - All-in-One</h2>

      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Quick answers, writing help, organization</p>
      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Free (integrated in Google)</p>
      <p><strong>Why students pick it:</strong> Works directly in Gmail and Google Docs (no app switching)</p>
      <p><strong>Features:</strong> Ask questions in Gmail, summarize long documents, help with Google Docs essays</p>

      <h2>5. GitHub Copilot (Free for Students) - Coding</h2>

      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Programming assignments, learning coding faster</p>
      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> FREE via GitHub Student Pack</p>
      <p><strong>How to get:</strong> https://education.github.com → Sign in with .edu email → Claim Copilot free for 1 year</p>
      <p><strong>What it does:</strong> In VS Code, type a function name and it suggests the entire function. Game-changer for coding classes.</p>

      <h2>Academic Integrity - DO's and DON'Ts</h2>

      <p><strong>✅ DO:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use AI for brainstorming and understanding concepts</li>
        <li>Ask AI to explain something you don't understand</li>
        <li>Use AI to check grammar and structure</li>
        <li>Let AI quiz you for exam prep</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>❌ DON'T:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Copy entire essay from AI (plagiarism detection catches this)</li>
        <li>Submit AI-written code as your own (professors know the patterns)</li>
        <li>Use AI to skip learning (you'll fail the exam)</li>
        <li>Plagiarize without citing (always mention you used AI)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> If you wouldn't show your professor what you did with AI, don't do it.</p>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <h3>Q: Will professors know if I use ChatGPT?</h3>
      <p>Honestly? Maybe. AI detectors exist but aren't perfect. The real risk: if your essay is better than your exam answers, it's suspicious. Use AI to improve your work, not replace it.</p>

      <h3>Q: Is using AI cheating?</h3>
      <p>It depends on your college's policies. Most allow AI for brainstorming and research. Submitting AI-written work as your own = cheating. Ask your professor if unsure.</p>

      <h3>Q: What if I have GitHub Student Pack but different email?</h3>
      <p>Use your .edu email. If your school doesn't give .edu emails, contact GitHub support.</p>

      <h3>Q: Can I use AI on exams?</h3>
      <p>Not unless your professor allows it. Most online exams now detect AI tool usage. Don't risk it.</p>
